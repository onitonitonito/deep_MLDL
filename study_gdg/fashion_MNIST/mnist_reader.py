#----------------------------------------------
# Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a
# training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example
# is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend
# Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST
# dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same
# image size and structure of training and testing splits.
